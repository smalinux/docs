# Tragedy story about upgrading libbpf manually:

1. I should know all libbpf places in my system:

    $ find / -name "libbpf.so*" 2> /dev/null
    $ find / -name "libbpf.pc" 2> /dev/null

    now you can sudo rm all these files or at least mv to a backup place.
    ex:
        $ rm /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libbpf.*

2. Is bpftool also up-to-date?

    cd linux-stable/tools/bpf && make && make install

3. compile and install libbpf for linux source tree:

    cd linux-stable/tools/lib/bpf/
    make
    make install

    IMPORTANT! libbpf get installed by default in /usr/local/lib64/
    i don't need that so:
    sudo cp -r /usr/local/lib64/* /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/

    this place is the master! you should have libbpf here!
        /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu

    All headers here:
        /usr/local/include/bpf/btf.h

4. make sure that this file is up-to-date! IMPORTANT because there is no script
will update that automatically: ./usr/include/linux/btf.h

    $ cp ~/repos/linux-stable/usr/include/linux/btf.h /usr/include/linux/
