BPF ring buffer (ringbuf). It is a multi-producer, single-consumer (MPSC) queue and can be safely shared across multiple CPUs simultaneously.

BPF ringbuf support a familiar functionality from BPF perfbuf:

variable-length data records;
ability to efficiently read data from user-space through memory-mapped region without extra memory copying and/or syscalls into the kernel;
both epoll notifications support, as well as an ability to busy-loop for the absolutely minimal latency.
At the same time, BPF ringbuf solves the following issues with BPF perfbuf:

memory overhead;
data ordering;
wasted work and extra data copying.
